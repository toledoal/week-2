## ToDo

1. Have a list of Tokens to display here: Choose 20,

get Token Address, Name, Symbol and Icon. (Not all tokens have symbol in their contracts)

2. Explore calls using web3 for getTransaction

3. Explore calls using web3 for Contract

4. Explore ABI for contracts and define to get information from ERC20 Token

5. Parse calls to get transactions, decode input and parse "transfers" from Token

6. Try to use Voronoi chart to map information from points (x: index, y: gas, size: value transfered of Token )

7. Show results

8. Extend web3 to use debug mode for transaction tracing

9. Implement d3 chart for information using nodes and arrow nodes
